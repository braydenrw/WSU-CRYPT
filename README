Description:
	    WSU-CRYPT is a block cipher that uses a 64-bit block size and a 
64-bit key size.

The program currently runs from main taking in text from 'plaintext.txt' and
either reading a key from key.txt or generating its own if user specifies. 
Then, main.py runs Encrypt() on the plaintext, storing the hex cipher-text in
'ciphertext.txt' and printing out to the user (for grader readability).  Then
decrypt runs on the cipher-text and prints out the plaintext created from the
hex string in 'ciphertext.txt'.
